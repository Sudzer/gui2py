gui2py is a GUI framework for building cross-platform "visual" desktop applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, 
using the Python language and the wxPython toolkit.

Its objetive is to evolve [PythonCard](http://pythoncard.sourceforge.net/) with [web2py's](http://www.web2py.com/) 
philosophy and facilities.

Its goals includes a KISS compact structure, visual tools (designer, inspector and property editor), 
HTML/Javascript-like capabilities, modern MVC patterns support, and compatibility with multiple versions of wxPython 
and Python (including py3k and the upcoming wx version 3.0 -a.k.a. Phoenix-).
